## What is an Agent Workflow?

An **agent workflow** is a sequence of interconnected nodes—such as triggers, agents, and tools—that automate tasks end-to-end.  
It combines multiple AI agents and integrations into a single process, allowing you to automate complex multi-step tasks easily.

## How to Create a Workflow

Creating an agent workflow is as simple as dragging and dropping components into our editor.
There are two primary ways to get started:

    href="/agent-workflows/create-workflow"
  >
    You can use one of our existing agent workflow templates created by domain
    experts on our team. Templates are fully customizable and let you get up and
    running faster.

    href="/agent-workflows/create-workflow"
  >
    Start with a blank canvas and build your agent workflow from scratch. This
    is great if you have a specific task in mind or want to build something
    unique from the ground up.

## How to Run a Workflow

Once your workflow is ready, you can test it directly within the editor to ensure everything runs smoothly.
The Use tab offers a clean, app-like interface where you can run your workflow and view all past runs.

    Use the <strong>Test</strong> button in the top right corner of the builder
    to run your workflow. Great for testing and validating that your workflow
    works as expected.

    The <strong>Use</strong> tab gives you a clean, app-like interface to run
    your workflow. You can also review all past runs and share the workflow with
    others.

## Key Workflow Components

Each agent workflow is built from a few key components.

| **Component**        | **Description**             | **Key Features**                                                                                                                        |
| :------------------- | :-------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Trigger**          | Workflow starting point     | • Manual, scheduled, or event-based<br/>• Accepts custom inputs<br/>• Kicks off the workflow                                            |
| **AI Agents**        | Intelligent task performers | • Powered by LLMs<br/>• Can reason and act autonomously<br/>• Can be equipped with tools<br/>• Supports Loop Mode and Structured Output |
| **App Integrations** | External system connectors  | • Connects to third-party services<br/>• Sends/receives data<br/>• Enables seamless automation across platforms                         |
| **Core Nodes**       | Workflow control logic      | • Loading data<br/>• Conditional flow between steps<br/>• Display Output                                                                |
| **Custom Tools**     | User-defined utilities      | • Perform custom actions<br/>• Call APIs or execute custom code<br/>• Tailored to your use case<br/>• Flexible input/output             |


## Share as Template

Make your workflows reusable by sharing them as templates with others in your team or community.

When you build a workflow, you have full control over how it’s shared.  
By default, your workflow is private—only accessible by you and your agents.

Click the <strong>Share</strong> button in the `Use` tab to generate a link that others can use to clone your workflow.
This makes it easy to reuse workflows across teams or build internal templates for repeatable tasks.
