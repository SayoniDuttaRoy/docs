title: Passing Data Between Steps
description: Learn how data flows between steps using variables in your agent workflows

### Getting Started with Variables

In your agent workflows, data is passed from one step to another using variables.
Variables are outputs generated by a step and can be inserted into the parameters of subsequent steps.
This makes your workflows dynamic and adaptable to different data inputs.

### Step Options & Variables

Every step has configurable **parameters** that determine its behavior. Options can accept either:

- **Static values:** Manually entered data.
- **Dynamic variables:** Data coming from a previous step.

For example, while configuring a `Google Search` query, you might want to customize the query using data from an earlier step.
To do this, simply click the `+` button next to the text field and select the appropriate variable.

### Using Variables Across Steps

To successfully pass a variable from one step to another, the two steps must be connected in your workflow. Here’s the simple rule:

- **Direct Connection:** If there’s a line connecting Step A to Step B, Step B can use the outputs from Step A.
- **Branching Workflows:** If steps are on separate branches without a connecting line, variables cannot be passed between them. To share data, ensure that the steps are connected in the same chain.

<Tip>
  Since all steps eventually originate from the Trigger step, variables from the
  Trigger step are available throughout the workflow, provided the connection
  exists.
</Tip>

### Inserting Variables into Step Parameters

To insert a variable into an parameter:

1. Click the **+** button near the input field.
2. A dropdown will display the available variables from previous steps.
3. Select the variable you wish to insert into the option.
