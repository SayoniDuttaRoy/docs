### How to Use a Template

1. **Browse Templates**  
   Head to the **Templates** tab in the dashboard to see all available agent workflow templates.
2. **Pick One That Fits**  
   Choose a template based on what you’re trying to automate — whether it’s lead research, reporting, content creation, or more.
3. **Make It Your Own**  
   - Edit the workflow name and description  
   - Add or remove steps (triggers, agents, tools, or integrations)  
   - Customize each agent’s instructions or behavior  
4. **Save and Run**  
   Once it looks good, hit **Save** — then **Run** the workflow and see it in action.
5. **Tweak Anytime**  
   You can update or build on the workflow at any time. Templates are just the starting point.
