### How to Create a Workflow

1. **Log in** to your [GenFuse AI account](https://genfuseai.com/sign-up).  
2. Navigate to the **Agent Workflows** page from the sidebar.  
3. Click **New Workflow** in the top-right corner.  
4. Choose one of the following options:  
   - **Use a Template** – Start from a prebuilt workflow designed for common use cases.  
   - **Start from Scratch** – Begin with a blank canvas and build your workflow step by step.  
5. In the `Config` tab, give your workflow a **name** and **description**.  
6. Click **Save** to create the workflow.  
7. Your workflow will now appear on the **Agent Workflows** page, where you can run, edit, or share it as needed.

You’re now ready to start designing your automation by adding triggers, agents, tools, and more.
