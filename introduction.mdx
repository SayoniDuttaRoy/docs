## Building your first agent workflow

In this guide, you will learn how to build an AI agent that performs in-depth research about any company and emails you a comprehensive report.

This lesson should take less than 5 minutes and once you're done, you'll have your own AI company research agent.

Let's dive in!

### Creating an agent workflow

> Agent workflows allow you to connect multiple AI agents and tools to create powerful automations. 
> Use our simple drag and drop editor to design your custom workflow in less than 5 minutes.

To create a new agent workflow:

1. [Sign Up](https://genfuseai.com/sign-up) in GenFuse AI
2. Once you've logged in, go to the [Agent Workflows](https://genfuseai.com/dashboard) page (in the sidebar)
3. Create a new workflow by clicking the button in the top right corner.

### Add a Trigger

> Triggers are events that start your workflow.
> Examples include manual triggers (run on demand), scheduled triggers (e.g. every weekday at 7 AM), or event-based triggers (e.g. when an email is received).

In this example, we'll set up a manual trigger that takes a company website as input.

1. Click the `Trigger` node in your workflow
2. Select `Manual` Trigger
3. Click `Add Input` and add `Company Website` as an input â€” this lets you provide custom data each time the workflow runs.
