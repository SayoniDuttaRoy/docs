## What is GenFuse AI?

GenFuse AI is a no-code platform where you can build custom AI agents and multi-agent teams to automate work.

Our AI agents can reason, use tools and self-correct, just like human employees.
Combine multiple AI agents and tools to seamlessly automate complex multi-step tasks.

Increase efficiency. Not headcount.

## How It All Works Together

1. **Trigger** starts the workflow.

2. **Agent Workflows** connect everything.
   This is where you combine agents, tools, and integrations to build your automation.

3. **AI Agents** are task specialists.
   Each agent focuses on a specific job â€” like research, summarization, or writing.

4. **App integrations** allow you to connect GenFuse AI workflows to external services and tools.
