## What is GenFuse AI?

GenFuse AI is a no-code platform where you can build custom AI agents and multi-agent teams to automate work. 

Our AI agents can reason, use tools and self-correct, just like human employees. 
Combine multiple AI agents and tools to seamlessly automate complex multi-step tasks.

Increase efficiency. Not headcount.

## Core Features

### AI Agents
AI agents are intelligent systems powered by LLMs that can perform multi-step tasks without human intervention. 
They can be equipped with tools and can autonomously decide how to use them to complete tasks.
Each agent is fully customizable.

### Agent Workflows
Agent workflows allow you to connect multiple AI agents and tools to create powerful automations. 
Use our simple drag and drop editor to design and deploy your custom workflow in minutes.

### Triggers
Triggers are events that start your workflow. 
Examples include manual triggers (run on demand), scheduled triggers (e.g. every weekday at 7 AM), or event-based triggers (e.g. when an email is received).

### Tools & Integrations
App integrations enable you to connect to third-party services like Google Search, Sheets, Email, Linkedin, Web Scrapers and more.
AI agents can use them as tools, or you can use them as nodes in your own workflows.

Absolutely — here’s a tighter, more concise version:

## How It All Works Together

1. **Trigger** starts the workflow.

2. **Agent Workflows** connect everything.
This is where you combine agents, tools, and integrations to build your automation.

3. **AI Agents** are task specialists. 
Each agent focuses on a specific job — like research, summarization, or writing.

4. **Tools** help agents get things done.
Tools/apps integrations can also be used directly in workflows without needing an agent — perfect for simple tasks like sending emails or scraping a site.
