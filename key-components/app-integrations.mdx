## What are App Integrations?

App integrations allow you to connect GenFuse AI workflows to external services and tools. This enables your agents to interact with real-world data, trigger actions in other applications, and create powerful, automated workflows that extend beyond the GenFuse AI platform.

<Tip>
App integrations bridge the gap between your AI agents and the outside world, allowing them to access and manipulate data from various sources.

2.  **Choose an Integration:** Select the desired app integration from the list.
3.  **Configure the Integration:** Configure the integration node by providing necessary credentials and settings.
4.  **Map Data:** Use the "+" button to map data from previous steps in the workflow to the integration node. This allows you to dynamically populate fields with data generated by your agents or other steps.
5.  **Test the Integration:** Run the workflow to test the integration and ensure it's working as expected.
