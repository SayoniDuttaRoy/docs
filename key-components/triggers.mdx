## What are Triggers?

Every agent workflow in GenFuse AI begins with a trigger. Triggers are the events that initiate your workflow, setting everything in motion. Choosing and configuring the right trigger is crucial for ensuring your workflows run exactly when you need them to.

<Tip>
Triggers are the starting point of your workflows. They define *when* and *how* your automated processes begin.

## Types of Triggers

GenFuse AI offers a variety of trigger types to suit different automation needs:

*   **Manual Trigger:** Starts the workflow on demand. Perfect for testing or when you need to initiate a process directly.
*   **Scheduled Trigger:** Runs the workflow on a predefined schedule (e.g., every day at 9 AM, every Monday, etc.). Ideal for recurring tasks.
*   **Event-Based Triggers:** Starts the workflow when a specific event occurs. (e.g., when you receive an email) (Coming Soon!)

## Configuring a Trigger

Here's how to configure a trigger for your workflow:

1.  **Add a Trigger Node:** Every workflow has a `Trigger` node added by default
2.  **Select Trigger Type:** Choose the type of trigger that best suits your needs (Manual, Scheduled, etc.).
3.  **Configure Trigger Details:**
    *   **Manual Trigger:** Add optional input fields to collect data when the workflow is run. This allows you to provide custom information each time the workflow is triggered.
    *   **Scheduled Trigger:** Set the schedule for when the workflow should run.
    *   **Event-Based Triggers:** Select the event you want to monitor.
4.  **Save the Trigger:** Save your trigger configuration to activate it.
